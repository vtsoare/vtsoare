Hello,
I'm Vlad Soare. I'm applying for entry positions in data analysis and/or data science after a long time in grad school.
MA in Linguistics with undergrad degrees in Marine Science, Bio, Classics and Anthro.
Currently learning Python (and libraries for data analysis, data visualization, modeling)

I'll be using this as a sort of portfolio, since I don't have previous work experience directly related to data analysis/science.

Feel free to get a hold of me @ vtsoare@gmail.com
